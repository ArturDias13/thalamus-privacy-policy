    <h1>Thalamus Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      Thalamus is a corporate application (MES – Manufacturing Execution System)
      intended for use by authorized users of specific companies. This Privacy
      Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      To enable authentication and proper operation of the application, Thalamus
      collects and stores the following personal data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Authentication information (access tokens)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These data are provided by the user in the context of corporate use and are
      strictly necessary for account management and access control.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
      The collected information is used exclusively for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>User authentication and authorization</li>
      <li>Account identification within the system</li>
      <li>Operational activity logging and traceability</li>
      <li>Security and proper functioning of the application</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visibility of Operational Records</h2>
    <p>
      In corporate environments, certain operational records (such as machine
      inspection data and the identification of the responsible user) may be
      visible to other authorized users within the same organization. This
      visibility is limited to operational and internal control purposes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Camera and Image Access</h2>
    <p>
      Thalamus may request access to the device camera and photo gallery to support
      features related to the application’s operational and functional use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such access may allow users to capture new images using the camera or select
      existing images from their device gallery in order to document, validate, or
      support activities performed within the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      All images are provided voluntarily by the user and are used exclusively for
      internal, operational, traceability, and quality-related purposes associated
      with the application’s functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Images may be stored and linked to system records and can be accessed only by
      authorized users within the same organization. Thalamus does not access the
      camera or gallery without user interaction, and does not use images for
      tracking, advertising, or unrelated purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Thalamus uses Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and diagnostic
      information. This data is technical in nature and is used exclusively to
      improve application stability and performance. The information collected
      by this service is not used for tracking or advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share personal user data with third parties, except when required
      by law or when necessary to provide essential services related to the
      application’s operation.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      User data is stored on proprietary backend infrastructure located in
      Brazil. Appropriate technical and organizational measures are applied to
      protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Users may request access to, correction of, or deletion of their personal
      data when applicable. Requests can be made through the contact information
      provided below.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Thalamus is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

      This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Users are encouraged to
      review it regularly.
